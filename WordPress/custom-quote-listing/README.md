# Quote Listings â€“ (Custom Plugin)

In this project, I developed a custom plugin empowering the customer to create a distinctive post type with specific attributes. Each post includes a Title, Description, Video ID, Password, and the ability to select a Template for customized layout preferences.
The client, operating in the insurance industry, sought a unique approach to sharing quotes by integrating videos for detailed explanations. To ensure confidentiality, the posts are password-protected, granting access only to intended users.
Moreover, recognizing the need for dynamic management of templates across multiple agents, the plugin was designed to seamlessly handle this functionality.
