# API Event Import Plugin

## Backend Development:

I spearheaded the creation of a specialized plugin designed for the seamless import of external events, storing them as a customized post type within the local database. This feature-rich plugin encompasses pivotal functionalities, including event addition, editing, deletion, and search capabilities. Moreover, it offers a streamlined shortcode generation mechanism, enabling the display of categorized events across multiple pages. Additionally, I meticulously tailored an event calendar to meet precise project requisites.
Admin Panel Integration:

Upon installation, the plugin introduces a dedicated admin panel page meticulously designed to manage and present the curated list of imported events. The admin panel features:

- Events Import Page (API Integration)
- Today's Events
- Upcoming Events
- Archived Events
- Shortcode Manager

## Frontend Development:

### User Interaction:

The frontend engagement is optimized through a user-friendly interface facilitating shortcode generation. Leveraging these shortcodes, diverse event types are displayed across distinct pages, offering a dynamic representation based on specified filters. Complementing this, an event calendar page showcases all current and upcoming events.

This custom plugin seamlessly integrates third-party event APIs, ensuring effortless management and integration of events within WordPress sites, enhancing overall usability and presentation.
